## Usage
```sh
git clone https://github.com/vinhnx/vinhnx.zsh-theme.git
cd vinhnx.zsh-theme
cp vinhnx.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes
```

Then open you .zshrc file and change theme name to `vinhnx`

It should look like this in your .zshrc file after editing:

`export ZSH_THEME="vinhnx"`

### Tips

Solarized theme can be found here, choose what suit you and install it.
* [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)

Personally, I use Console2 with Cywin and Zsh, so I chose the scheme for my console2 here
