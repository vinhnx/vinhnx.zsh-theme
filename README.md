# oh-my-zsh theme
This is my custom theme for oh-my-zsh (zshell) with minimal effort. 
Look great when using with in Solarized theme.

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/vinhnx/vinhnx.zsh-theme.git
cd vinhnx.zsh-theme
cp vinhnx.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes
```

Then open you `.zshrc` file and change the theme name to `vinhnx`

It should look like this in your `.zshrc` file after editing:

`export ZSH_THEME="vinhnx"`

### Tips*

Solarized theme can be found here, choose one that suits you, then install it.
- [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)

I personally use Console2  with Cygwin and Zsh, so I choose the theme for my console2 that can be also found here:
